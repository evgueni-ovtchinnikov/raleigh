This release adds features that facilitate the user's development of interactive truncated SVD and PCA code. The use of these new features is demonstrated by the new icompute_eigenimages.py example script.

## v1.1

This release mostly introduces substantial changes in computing Lower Rank Approximations (LRA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
- Files/folders rearranged.
- PCA/LRA update implemented.
- Incremental PCA/LRA implemented.
- Comparisons with sklearn pca added to some examples.
- Simple usage examples via doctest added in pca() docstring.
- A simple alternative to docopt implemented in example scripts to avoid forcing the user to install it.
